# Nand2Tetris: part 1 solutions

Absolutely amazing course available at https://www.nand2tetris.org/. 

Building the Hack computer by scratch using logic gates is a great experience for those who enjoy learning about low level hardware.

Looking forward to potentially completing part 2 in the future.
