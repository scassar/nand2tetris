# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris I

Absolutely amazing course available at https://www.nand2tetris.org/. 

Building the Hack computer by scratch using logic gates is a great experience for those who enjoy learning about low level hardware.

Below is a brief description of the projects, and also you can find my solutions to course problems in this repository.

## Project 1 to 3

Key focus here was building basic chips out of low level gates. Project 1 focused on building each of the base logic chips starting with a Nand gate, moving up to memory.
It was interesting to build and form the basis of a 16 full adder, 16 bit registers which make up the structure of a ROM/RAM and also building a program controller. This was all done using a specification of HDL.

## Project 4

This project focuses on the building of programs using the Hack assembly language. We were required to build 2 programs that focused on manipulating ram, the virtual screen and all using inputs from a virtual keyboard.

## Project 5

Time to put everything together. This unit was about combinining all knowledge gained prior, into building the CPU, RAM, and Computer. This computer can execute the instructions provided by the Hack assembly. 

## Project 6

Enter more software! We pulled everything together and were required to write our own assembler for the Hack computer. I decided to use Python for this part of the course as its a language I had some experience in.

Still deciding if I want to pursue Nand2Tetris part 2, where we will focus on abstracting away from the assembly level - building our own VM translation layer and higher programming language called Jack.
